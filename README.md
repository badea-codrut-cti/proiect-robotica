# Self Parking Toy Car

## Introduction

The project consists of a toy car that, when placed in the general direction of a a parking space, it will try to steer itself into said parking space. A parking space is determined by three obstacles and an opening, i.e two parked cars and a wall. The car will use two ultrasonic sensors to measure the distance on its front left and front right and determine whether it is approaching an obstacle and in which direction. With that information, it will try to steer itself away from said obstacle. It will consider the parking maneuver finished once it gets close enough to the wall (which is determined by both sensors reporting similar distances).
